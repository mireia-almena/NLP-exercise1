# NLP-exercise1
Exercise 1 for the NLP course at UPF. This project investigates whether Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation holds in the musical genre for two languages: English and Catalan. Zipf’s Law of Abbreviation states that more frequently used words in a language are, on average, shorter in length (fewer letters or syllables) than less frequent words. The goal of this analysis is to examine whether this relationship also appears in song lyrics, which differ from standard written prose.
